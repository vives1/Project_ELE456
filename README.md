# Project_ELE456

### CavityBloch
MATLAB code to solve Cavity-Bloch equations and produce plots.
### Experimental Measurement of Cavity Pull 
Qiskit code to measure chi 
### QuTiP_simulation 
Solving the system using the Lindblad master equation solver and produce plots.

### Cavity Dynamics
IBM Q's measurement of the cavity field as a function of time. The cavity is coupled to a transmon qubit. As such the cavity field is measured for the qubit in both the ground and excited states. The pi-pulse used to excite the qubit is obtained from the latest backend calibration.

### Rabi Pulses Notebook
This notebook conducts several experiments that measure the cavity field with time. For each experiment, the amplitude of a Gaussian driving pulse is varied. This induces Rabi-Oscillations in the system. By measuring the response of the cavity field, we can compute the qubit excited state population p_e as done by Bianchetti et. al. This is done in a related MATLAB file.
